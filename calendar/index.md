There are two Options for Mod 0 per Cohort: one starting 6 weeks before, and another starting 3 weeks before your first Mod 1 course. You can choose whichever Mod 0 course works best for your schedule. You can expect to work 18-20 hours/week during the three-week period. Each Mod 0 course includes 5 total live sessions, held remotely over Zoom.

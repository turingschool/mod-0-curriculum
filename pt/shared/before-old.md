title: Before Starting Mod 0
---

**Before your the Mod 0 Kickoff**, we ask that you complete the following tasks to familiarize yourself with the tools we use and ensure that you are set up to be successful.

**PLEASE PLAN TO SPEND ABOUT 6 HOURS ON THESE TASKS!**

## Index (time estimates)

1. Read Course Syllabus, Calendar (10-30 min)
1. Computer Setup (60-120 min)
1. Slack (15 min)
1. Remote Workspace (5 min)
1. Notetaking (20 min)
1. Thoughts on Professionalism (10 min)
1. Terminal Lesson (60 min)


## Read Course Syllabus, Calendar

Navigate to the main page of this site and locate the Syllabus and Calendar pages, both linked in the main navigation bar. Read them each carefully and make sure you understand the expectations for Mod 0, including the dates.

## Complete the Computer Setup

It is **essential** that you set up your computer according to the instructions outlined in the [Computer Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup). On occasion, students run into problems installing some of the programs, so it is advised you start this sooner than later in the event you need to reach out for support on Slack.

## Slack

Slack is our main communication tool at Turing. **You will receive an invitation to join the Turing Workspace 2 Fridays before your Mod 0 start date**. To ensure that you are prepared for your first session:
- Watch the [Slack Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfq333EpWgM)
- Upload a clear and appropriate headshot for your profile image
- Set up your Slack profile to include your cohort, program, pronouns, and timezone
- Practice the following (direct message yourself to practice!):
  - How to start a thread
  - How to reply in a thread
  - How to format an `inline code example`
  - How to create a larger code snippet, as such:
    ```
      You can create multi-line
      code snippets in Slack
      That make it easier to share larger blocks of code
    ```

## Remote Workspace

Read this guide on [how to prepare your supplies and workspace]({{ sitebaseurl }}/remote-workspace). Take any actions steps necessary to prepare yourself for remote learning.

## Notetaking

Many of you are entering an academic setting for the first time in many years. Your experience at Turing will likely be much different than your previous academic experiences! We will use Mod 0 to start preparing you for the expectations at Turing, so that you can start learning technical content on the first day of Mod 1.

One area instructors have reported students that struggle with is **how** and **when** to take notes, especially when it comes to technical content. [This guide provides some exemplar note taking strategies as well as some tips and tricks.](https://gist.github.com/ericweissman/a729a849ed6355ed8ee0c9156a8e9c98)

## Read Thoughts on Professionalism

Read [these reflections](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LNyXge4p6OQTWbo_Y9XIJAF2LEwNnN4P/view) from a former student and take notes on the following:
1. What stood out to you as you read this?
1. What surprised you after reading this?
1. How will this impact your approach to Mod 0?

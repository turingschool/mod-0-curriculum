## Turing Mission and Expectations

> “Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.”

* We all have different backgrounds and experiences
* Listen and learn from one another's perspectives

### A different type of learning environment

Turing is a very challenging experience for most people. To be successful here, I'd highly recommend that you embrace a **growth mindset**. This means that you believe that knowledge and intelligence can be improved through hard work and dedication and that you may fail at something before you're successful at it. It's the difference between being good at something right off the bat, and working hard to get good at something that sets people apart here.

**This is not traditional education**
* You will not be given all of the answers
* We expect you to do your own research
* Technology is constantly changing
* Learning how to learn

**There is no transcript** - Sure, you'll get a diploma upon graduation, but we don't have GPAs at Turing and grades are not the measurement of success. **We measure success in understanding.** Throughout your time at Turing, you'll have projects and assessments that will allow us as instructors to gauge your success. This is because the ultimate goal here is for you to get a job in software development. And to do so, you need to show understanding during the interview process.

### Communication

Make sure that you've added the **[Mod 0 Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Y2FzaW1pcmNyZWF0aXZlLmNvbV8xMnA0NjkzaG1lcjFvcmNlcHA3NHZnNzdwZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)** to your own calendar. This is where you will find all mod 0 related events, including sessions, mod 1 pre-work study sessions, and other community wide events.

We will also remind you when these events are via **[slack](https://turingschool.slack.com/)**, which is the **primary mode of communication** we use at Turing. Make sure that you're checking it once a day so that you can stay up to date. It's also a great place to ask questions if you are running into issues, as people are likely experiencing the same issue that you are.

* Let's practice a couple of slack features right now! Watch as we show you how to make and write in threads.
  * Thread: What is your favorite food?

## Mod 0 Expecations

Mod 0 is less about code or solving difficult problems and more about developing and learning tools, procedures, systems, and  learning behaviors/processes. For some of you, the technical content will be brand new. For others, it will be review.

At the end of Session 4, you'll take a technical assessment that will showcase a subset skills you learned during Mod 0. The assessment will be performance-based rather than multiple choice. The assessment instructions will include a checklist of what we're looking for to know that you've practiced and mastered the material.

### Being Turing Ready

At the end of mod 0, you'll be considered one of the following:

**Not Ready** based on any of these factors:
 * You’ve missed more than one session or did not meet engagement expectations
 * You’ve missed assignments or delivered poor quality work
 * You were unable to pass the Technical Assessment
 * You were unable to pass the Mod 1 Pre-work
   * *Next step:* You have one chance to re-enroll in and successfully complete Mod 0
 * If you don’t pass on your second try you will be asked to reapply to Turing in 6 months.

**Technical Ready**
 * Your work and assessment have met the expectations of mod 0
 * *Next step:* Submit your Program-Specific Mod 1 Pre-work

If your Mod 1 Pre-work meets expectations, you'll be **Turing Ready**

  <h3>Break out rooms</h3>
  <p>1. What is one reason you chose to come to Turing?</p>
  <p>2. What is your biggest concern about coming to Turing?</p>
  <p>3. What is a skill or focus area that you want to be held accountable on during mod 0?</p>
  <p>ie. Asking questions during sessions, sticking to a calendar, using a planner</p>

### Study Habits

Throughout your time at Turing, including mod 0 we'd suggest that you get in the habit of doing the following:

#### Pre-teaching
* Preview: Up to 24 hours prior
  * Check out the lesson plan
  * Peek at coding examples
  * Record new vocab in Turing Notebook

#### Take great notes (during the lesson)
* Notebook: Start now with handwritten notes
* Visual organization: Colors/markers/pens/stickies
* Diagrams: Draw out everything your instructors draw on board
* KEY ideas: Focus on main concepts, write in your own words

#### Post-teaching
* Review: At lesson’s close
  * What do I understand from today?
  * When will I need what I just learned?
  * What questions do I still have?
* Do your own research!
* Experiment!

### Study Habits (focus)
* Limit distractions. Turn off:
  * Notifications (slack, imessage, etc)
  * Phone (or airplane mode, and out of sight)

* Location, location, location:
  * Make sure that your space is quiet and free from distractions
  * Leave house if need be

### Study Habits (goals)
* Study/Worktime goal:
  * Write priorities in your notebook for each study/work session (get granular)
  * Use checklists and kanban tracking
* Pomodoros:
  * Use a TIMER and stick to it. ([befocused timer - free on App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973130201))
  * Plan for focus and recovery (you’ll get more done!)

### Organization
* Try to develop a schedule similar to your pre-turing life (ie. if you exercise before work, keep doing so before class)
* Procrastination does not work at Turing
* Get a planner to help prioritize work

### Community
  * You're joining a community of really wonderful people - take advantage!
  * I'd encourage y'all to poke around slack and join any channels that interest you

## Intro

* Instructor intros: Eric, Margo, and Ellen
* Goals for session (see above)
* Follow along by clicking the lesson plan in slack

## Housekeeping and Follow-ups

* Change display name in Zoom by clicking the **Participants** menu and choosing **Rename**. Make sure to match the following format:
  - Color Status ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¡ ðŸŸ  ðŸ”´
    - To open the Emoji menu on Mac, click in any text field and press `CONTROL + COMMAND + SPACE`
    - Search for `Green`, `Yellow`, `Orange`, or `Red` to pick the appropriate color based on your current status
  - First name
  - Last initial
  - Pronouns
  - Program (FE or BE)
  - Example: ðŸŸ¡ Eric W (he/him, FE)
* Sessions will be recorded and posted in Slack
* No computer yet? Don't fret for today. If you don't have a mac, please reach out to me! (Eric Weissman or @ericweissman)

### Breakout Rooms

This is a feature in zoom that we'll use throughout the mod 0 sessions. They allow for small group discussion, where y'all can solidify concepts or work through challenges. You'll be kicked out into smaller group with 2 or 3 of your classmates. When they're finished you'll get a 30 second warning where you can rejoin the main session, or you'll automatically rejoin at the end of the 30 seconds. During these, we may broadcast messages or pop in to see how we are doing time-wise.

Some norms before heading in:
* Be aware and try not talk over others.
* Leave space and time for everyone to share.

Breakout groups can be a bit awkward at first, but try to embrace them and have fun!

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Break out rooms</h3> 5 minutes (groups of 3 or 4)
  <p>1. Introduce yourself (name, pronouns, program)</p>
  <p>2. Where do you call home</p>
  <p>3. What were your takeaways from the orientation video that you watched in preparation for class?</p>
  <p>4. Done? What questions do you still have?</p>
</div>

Other things to note as we go through Mod 0:

- <strong>Zoom</strong>: turn video on, turn mic off unless speaking
- <strong>You can raise your hand using zoom</strong>: go ahead and try it now!
- <strong>Problems or individual questions during the Zoom session?</strong> Send a message in the chat!

## Mythbusting @ Turing
#### Myth 1 - The "Lone Wolf" Approach
We've met many propspective students who think that they can succeed at Turing (and in programming) by doing things alone. If you've said to yourself, "I'm just going to do my thing and the only reason I'm here is to learn to code..." you should probably chose a different program.

Turing and software development is inherently collaborative. Our project-based learning approach requires teammwork, collaboration and making sacrifices. If you want to only focus on "coding", it's probably best to just choose another program or learn on your own. Good luck getting a job, though!

#### Myth 2- "FE is harder! No - BE is harder!"
Reality check - both frontend development and backend development are "hard". That is why salaries are high for positions in this field! At Turing, you will get exposure to the "full stack" - in fact, your final module will be a combined cohort of frontend and backend students! 

#### Myth 3 - People "fail" Turing due to the technical content
Believe it or not, 99% of failing projects at Turing have little to do with technical deficits. Instead, poor communication and issues with collaboration are the main cause of failing projects. Remember, your Turing experience is designed to prepare you for the actual job - collaborating and communicating under tight deadlines is what makes the job difficult! 

## Setup for Success: Notetaking x Technical Content
Many of you are diving back into an academic setting for the first time in awhile. To be clear, the Turing experience is likely MUCH different than your previous academic experiences! We will use Mod 0 to start preparing you to kick ass at Turing and start your transformation into a developer off on the right foot.

One area we notice students struggle with is how and when to take notes. Before we go into specifics, take a look at [these notes](https://gist.github.com/ericweissman/a729a849ed6355ed8ee0c9156a8e9c98) created by some of our most successful students.

- What things stand out as your look at these examples?
- How do these examples compare to your current notes?

<a name="notetaking"></a>

#### Tips for Strong Notetaking @ Turing
- **Setup is a key to success:** Having an organization strategy can make it easier to use your notes as a tool. We recommend creating a `Table of Contents ` to make it easier to reference your notes. Also, taking notes on key vocabulary BEFORE a lesson has been useful for some students!
- **Use different colors:** This can help with modeling syntax highlighting, making notes easier to read, draw attention to different content
- **Leave plenty of whitespace:** Allows you to add more context, write questions, make connections
- **Draw or diagram often:** Many concepts can be difficult to understand with just words, use drawings/diagrams to help synthesize and frame information
- **Pen + Paper > Digital:** Don't rely on taking notes on your computer. Studies have proven that you will retain more information by physically writing your notes. Plus, it will make diagramming and drawing easier! 

## BREAK 

Turn off your mics and videos and walk away from the computer. Stand up, stretch, drink water. Do a few sit-ups, squats, push-ups, jumping jacks, arm circles, stress ball squeezes, or whatever else moves your body.

<a name="findinganswers"></a>
## Googling

Believe it or not, a good chunk of your time as a programmer will be spent Googling to find answers to your questions. In fact, a somewhat experienced programmer will Google at a much higher rate than a beginning programmer. Therefore, it's really important to get good at Googling.

For a frame of reference so that you know just how often we rely on Google (even the "easy" stuff), this is my most recent Chrome history as I've been building this curriculum ðŸ˜‚

<img style="width: 50%" src="images/rachel_history.png" alt="Rachel's search history">

When I Google programming questions, I _usually_ include three things (in varying orders):

<ol>
  <li>What I want to do (verb)</li>
  <li>to what thing (noun)</li>
  <li>using what language or tool</li>
</ol>

For example, if I wanted to add a thick green border to a heading on my webpage and I'm using plain CSS for styling, I might google this:

```
how to add border to heading css
```

or

```
make border on heading element css
```
<strong>SUPER IMPORTANT:</strong> You might not get the results you're looking for on the first go-around.

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Writing Google-able Phrases</h3>
  <p>Write out Google-able search phrases for each of the following scenarios. Do not get hung up on being unfamiliar with the terminology for each scenario. We just want phrases to put into Google.</p>
  <p>1. I am using Git for version control and made a typo in a commit message. I need to change it before I push my changes to GitHub.</p>
  <textarea rows="2">
    Phrase 1:
    Phrase 2:
  </textarea>
  <p>2. I got this error message when I ran my Ruby program and I don't know what it means or how to fix it: <em>"unterminated string meets end of file"</em></p>
  <textarea rows="2">
    Phrase 1:
    Phrase 2:
  </textarea>
</div>

### Sifting Through Results

Once you formulate a good Google search and receive your results, there are a few things you'll want to consider when determining which results to open.

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Demo: Google Results</h3>
  <p>We'll look through some Google results for "how do you find out the length of a string in javascript?". Be ready to jot down tips for sifting through results.</p>
</div>

<a name="classes"></a>
## Classes

### Defining and Identifying Classes

**Note**: This is a topic that we will revisit in bite-size chunks leading up to Session 4. We will not talk about the technical aspects of how classes play a part in programming today; instead, we will apply the terminology and concepts to real life.

Think of a <span class="vocab">class</span> as a category of thing. For example, deep dish, new york, and pan are all different versions or <span class="vocab">instances</span> of a **Pizza** (class).

Bandit the dog and Pumpernickel the cat are different instances of a **Pet** (class).

My copy of _Lonesome Dove_ by Larry McMurtry and my copy of _Becoming_ by Michelle Obama (instances) are different instances of a **Book** (class).

Class names are always singular and PascalCase: **Pizza** (instead of pizzas), **Pet** (instead of pets), and **GolfCourse** instead of Golf Course.

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Classes Practice</h3>
  <p>Post two sentences in the chat using this structure:</p>
  <p>______, ________, and _______ (instances) are different versions of a ________ (class).</p>
</div>

### Attributes of Classes

An <span class="vocab">attribute</span> of a class is a characteristic that every instance of that class has.

For example:

- Each instance of a **Pizza** (class) has a crust, sauce, and toppings (attributes).
- Each instance of a **Pet** (class) has a color, species, size, number_of_legs, temperament, and age (attributes).
- Each instance of a **Book** (class) has a title, author, publisher, published_date, and total_pages (attributes).

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Attributes Practice</h3>
  <p>Post two sentences in the chat about your two classes using this structure:</p>
  <p>Each instance of a _______ (class) has a _______, ________, and ________ (attributes).</p>
</div>

<a name="datatypes"></a>
## Basic Data Types + Variable Assignment

In most programming languages, you'll find the same basic <span class="vocab">data types</span>. A data type represents the kind of data that you can use in the programming language. In this section, we'll discuss five different basic data types that are applicable to both the front end and back end. Luckily for us, the <span class="vocab">syntax</span> (the way we write) for these basic data types is almost identical in Ruby and JavaScript.

 
### Data Type Use Cases and Syntax Practice
We are going to break out into program specfiic small groups to start working through these skills!
- [Frontend: Data Types + Variable Assignment in Javascript](./data-types-fe.md)
- [Backend: Data Types + Variable Assignment in Ruby](./data-types-be.md)


## Close Out

Key takeaways from today:
* You should have a better understanding of the skills + mindsets necessary to succeed at Turing
* You should understand how to google programming questions
* You should understand what data types are and how you can use them with variables

<a name="homework"></a>
## Homework

Find the homework in your Mod 0 Trello Board. Contact your instructors if you're stuck (or better yet, post in the public slack channel as you're likely not the only one running in to that issue)

Also, if you haven't already, I would encourage you to start your mod 1 pre-work, as it'll help you work on your program specific skills and it is due in a few weeks

<a name="shortcuts"></a>
## Keyboard Shortcuts

Most computer users rely heavily on the mouse to open applications, interact with programs, etc. You might think that you're quick with a mouse, but just wait until you get good at <span class="vocab">keyboard shortcuts</span>.

Initially, your flow will be slower as you learn and memorize each of the shortcuts. However, if you force yourself to use these shortcuts, you'll become MUCH faster in the long run.

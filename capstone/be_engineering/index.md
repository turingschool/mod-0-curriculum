### Technical Capstone

The technical capstone can be completed in 8 days, with one day for setup. However, it is highly recommended that you begin  immediately. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort on the tasks for each day - about 30 hours total. This should help you to establish a routine of coding every day.

At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This capstone is designed to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.

After completing the capstone, you should be able to do the following:

* Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)
* Develop a basic knowledge of Ruby in order to build a simple program (for show and tell)

If you have more than 7 days to work on the capstone, you should break up the work and complete the Next Steps section below so that you are coding every day!

The link below will take you to the Github page that contains all the Technical work. Scroll through the page to find the instructions for getting your computer setup and getting started.

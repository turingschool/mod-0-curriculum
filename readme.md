## Structure of the site and where to find the most important things:

You will find a session specific directory. eg `session1`. All files within this site can be written as either markdown or html.

The `navigation.html` file is where you will find the sidebar for the site.

## Some handy tips for editing/creating content

### Headers in your markdown files

Put something like this at the top of all your markdown files:

```yaml
---
title: Name of Session
subheading: topics
layout: page
---
```

- `subheading` is optional
- `layout` will always going to be `page`

### Links and Paths

When linking to a markdown file, drop the `.md` in your link. Instead of linking to `name_of_file.md`, just use `name_of_file`. Other files, like PDFs and PNGs, keep the original extension.

#### Absolute vs Relative paths

Use *relative* links instead of *absolute* links. 

### Conventions

- Put a space after your `#`'s in headers
- Put a blank line between your headers and any content below
- Replace any `|` with `\|` unless you're really trying to do a table

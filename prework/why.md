title: Prep Your "Why"
---

During the first session of Mod 0, you will break out into small groups and share your “why” for taking this step to change careers, and your life. Spend some time reflecting on your motivations for being here, and how to communicate that best to your peers so they start to understand you and what drives you. Be prepared to share that with the group in 1-2 minutes. 

**Here are some reflection questions to help you get started:**
- Why did you come to Turing?
- What is the thing that will motivate you to keep going on the days/weeks you feel <em>most</em> challenged at Turing?
- Imagine yourself one year from today after completing Turing's program. How has your life changed for the better?

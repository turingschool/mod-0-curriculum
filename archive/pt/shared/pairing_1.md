title: Pairing in Class 3
---

## Learning Goals

- Get to know a classmate and collaborate on technical work
- Identify strengths and opportunities when observing others pair program
- Screen share, type in front of others, and communicate technical concepts

## Discussions

When you enter the breakout room with your partner, spend a few minutes getting to know each other, learning about their experience in Mod 0 so far. Then, discuss the following questions regarding yesterday's assignment:
- What is your understanding of Pair Programming, specifically the Driver Navigator style?
- What stuck out to you while watching the video of Kaitlyn and Amy pair?
- As it relates to pairing, what are you nervous about? Excited about? Confused about?

## Deciding Roles

Below are two short exercises for you to pair on. Decide who will be the Driver and Navigator for the first challenge, then switch roles for the second exercise.

## Exercises

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Pairing Exercise 1</h3>
  <p>This exercise should look very familiar!</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Navigate to your root directory.</li>
    <li>If you have a Turing and/or Mod 0 directory, navigate to that (highly recommended)!</li>
    <li>Create a new directory called <code>to_do</code>. Inside of that directory, create a file called <code>tasks.md</code>.</li>
    <li>Initialize Git inside of the <code>to_do</code> directory so that we have Git available to track changes.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Add <code>tasks.md</code> to the staging area.</li>
    <li>Make your first commit in this directory.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Use Atom to add three separate tasks to <code>tasks.md</code>.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Before you check the difference between your last commit and what the file looks like now, predict what it will say. Then, check the diff.</li>
    <li>Add the changes to the staging area.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Commit the changes using a properly formatted commit message.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

  <h3>Pairing Exercise 2</h3>
  <p>This exercise does not explicitly prompt you to predict what will happen after running each command, but it's a habit we recommend you push yourself to building.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new directory called <code>ruby_101</code>. Inside of that directory, create a file called <code>learning_ruby.md</code>.</li>
    <li>Initialize Git inside of the <code>ruby_101</code> directory so that we have Git available to track change.</li>
    <li>Check the current status.</li>
    <li>Add <code>learning_ruby.md</code> to the staging area.</li>
    <li>Commit your work.</li>
    <li>In Atom, create a header and either a fact or question about Ruby in the  <code>ruby_101.md</code> file.</li>
    <li>Add the changes to the staging area.</li>
    <li>Commit the changes using a properly formatted commit message.</li>
    <li>Create a directory inside of <code>ruby_101</code> titled <code>practice</code>. Inside of that, create 3 files - you choose the names.</li>
    <li>Add some content to each of the three files inside the <code>practice</code> directory.</li>
    <li>Add and commit your changes.</li>
    <li>Check the status to ensure you have a clean working tree.</li>
  </ol>

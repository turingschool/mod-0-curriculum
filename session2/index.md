## Intro

* Intros: Rachel and Tim
* Goals for session (see above)
* Bookmark this page with the shortcut `command + d`

## Housekeeping 

* Did you install Spectacle? 
* Change display name to first name, last initial, pronouns, program; ie - `Rachel W. (she/her, BE)`
* Session will be recorded and posted in Slack
* Find a typo?

## Mod 0 Expecations

Mod 0 is less about code or solving difficult problems and more about developing and learning tools, procedures, systems, and  learning behaviors/processes. For some of you, the technical content will be brand new. For others, it will be review. 

At the end of Session 5, you'll take a technical assessment that will showcase a subset skills you learn during Mod 0. The assessment will be performance-based rather than multiple choice. The assessment instructions will include a checklist of what we're looking for to know that you've practiced and mastered the material. 

Successful completion of assignments, session engagement, and the Session 5 Technical Assessment will result in a rating of "Turing-Ready." At any point if you feel like you may not meet the expectations, or you need advice/guidance on meeting an expectation, please reach out via Slack to either Rachel, Tim, or Sarah. 

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Planning your Growth (Break out rooms)</h3>
  <p>1. Introduce yourself (name, pronouns, most unbelievable fact about yourself).</p>
  <p>2. Out of the list above, which 2-3 skills will be your focus for the next week, and how will you improve them? For example, if I want to work on <strong>participation</strong>, I might share:</p>
  <em>I will type questions into the chat box when I don't understand something and I will volunteer to share my answers even if I'm not sure I'm right.</em>
  <p>3. How will you hold yourself accountable?</p>
</div>

Other things to note as we go through Mod 0:

- <strong>Zoom</strong>: turn video on, turn mic off unless speaking
- <strong>Breakout Rooms</strong>: don't be afraid to speak! Breakout rooms will be randomized at the beginning of each session, but continue to rely on your accountabilabuddy groups from Session 1 between sessions
- <strong>Problems or individual questions during the Zoom session?</strong> Message the non-presenting host (either Rachel or Tim)
- <strong>NOTE</strong>: text typed into this page will not save, so don't refresh or close this window until you've reviewed your notes. 

<a name="shortcuts"></a>
## Keyboard Shortcuts

Most computer users rely heavily on the mouse to open applications, interact with programs, etc. You might think that you're quick with a mouse, but just wait until you get good at <span class="vocab">keyboard shortcuts</span>. 

Initially, your flow will be slower as you learn and memorize each of the shortcuts. However, if you force yourself to use these shortcuts, you'll become MUCH faster in the long run.

## Classes

### Defining and Identifying Classes

**Note**: This is a topic that we will revisit in bite-size chunks leading up to Session 5. We will not talk about the technical aspects of how classes play a part in programming today; instead, we will apply the terminology and concepts to real life.

Think of a <span class="vocab">class</span> as a category of thing. For example, my sister's children Landon, Luca, and Arlo (instances) are all different versions of a **child** (class). 

My Old Navy sweatshirt and my American Giant sweatshirt (instances) are different versions of a **sweatshirt** (class).

_Great Expectations_ by Charles Dickens and _Becomming_ by Michelle Obama (instances) are different versions of a **book** (class). 

Class names are always singular: **child** (instead of children), **sweatshirt** (instead of sweatshirts), and **book** instead of books. 

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Classes</h3>
  <p>Post two sentences in the chat using this structure:</p>
  <p>______, ________, and _______ (instances) are different versions of a ________ (class).</p>
</div>

### Attributes of Classes

An <span class="vocab">attribute</span> of a class is a characteristic that every instance of that class has.

For example: 

- Each **child** (class) has a first_name, last_name, and birthdate (attributes).
- Each **sweatshirt** (class) has a color, size, brand, and price (attributes).
- Each **book** (class) has a title, author, publisher, published_date, and total_pages (attributes). 

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Attributes</h3>
  <p>Post two sentences in the chat about your two classes using this structure:</p>
  <p>Each _______ (class) has a _______, ________, and ________ (attributes).</p>
</div>

<a name="findinganswers"></a>
## Googling

Believe it or not, a good chunk of your time as a programmer will be spent Googling to find answers to your questions. In fact, a somewhat experienced programmer will Google at a much higher rate than a beginning programmer. Therefore, it's really important to get good at Googling. 

For a frame of reference so that you know just how often we rely on Google (even the "easy" stuff), this is my most recent Chrome history as I've been building this curriculum 😂

<img style="width: 50%" src="images/rachel_history.png" alt="Rachel's search history">

When I Google programming questions, I _usually_ include three things (in varying orders): 

<ol>
  <li>What I want to do (verb)</li>
  <li>to what thing (noun)</li>
  <li>using what language or tool</li>
</ol>

For example, if I wanted to add a thick green border to a heading on my webpage and I'm using plain CSS for styling, I might google this:

```
how to add border to heading css
```

or

```
make border on heading element css
```
<strong>SUPER IMPORTANT:</strong> You might not get the results you're looking for on the first go-around.

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Writing Google-able Phrases</h3>
  <p>Write out Google-able search phrases for each of the following scenarios. Do not get hung up on being unfamiliar with the terminology for each scenario. We just want phrases to put into Google.</p>
  <p>1. I am using Git for version control and made a typo in a commit message. I need to change it before I push my changes to GitHub.</p>
  <textarea rows="2">
    Phrase 1: 
    Phrase 2: 
  </textarea>
  <p>2. I got this error message when I ran my Ruby program and I don't know what it means or how to fix it: <em>"unterminated string meets end of file"</em></p>
  <textarea rows="2">
    Phrase 1: 
    Phrase 2: 
  </textarea>
  <p>3. A Mod 0 homework assignment asks you to print out your git log in oneline format and Rachel definitely did not teach how to do this during class.</p>
  <textarea rows="2">
    Phrase 1: 
    Phrase 2: 
  </textarea>
</div>

### Sifting Through Results

Once you formulate a good Google search and receive your results, there are a few things you'll want to consider when determining which results to open. 

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Demo: Google Results</h3>
  <p>We'll look through some Google results for "change width of textarea in html". Be ready to jot down tips for sifting through results.</p>
</div>

## BREAK

Turn off your mics and videos and walk away from the computer. Stand up, stretch, drink water. Do a few sit-ups, squats, push-ups, jumping jacks, arm circles, stress ball squeezes, or whatever else moves your body. 

<a name="datatypes"></a>
## Basic Data Types 

In most programming languages, you'll find the same basic <span class="vocab">data types</span>. A data type represents the kind of data that you can use in the programming language. In this section, we'll discuss five different basic data types that are applicable to both the front end and back end. 

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Basic Data Type Definitions</h3>
  <p>In your breakout groups, discuss and/or use Google to figure out what each of the following data types are used for in programming. Use your notebook to jot down your answer (and examples, if applicable).</p>

  <p>1. <strong>What are <span class="vocab">strings</span> used for in programming?</strong></p>
  <p>2. <strong>What are <span class="vocab">integers</span> and <span class="vocab">floats</span> are used for in programming</strong>?</p>
  <p>3. <strong>What is a <span class="vocab">boolean</span> value used for in programming</strong>?</p>
  <p>4. <strong>What is an <span class="vocab">array</span> used for in programming?</strong></p>
  <p>5. If you're in the front end program, we're going to call the next data type an <span class="vocab">object</span>. If you're in the back end program, we're going to call it a <span class="vocab">hash</span>. <strong>What is this data type used for in programming?</strong></p>
</div>


### Data Type Use Cases and Syntax

Luckily for us, the <span class="vocab">syntax</span> (the way we write) for these basic data typs is almost identical in Ruby and JavaScript. 

Imagine that we're making an application for grocery stores to use (intentionally vague description 😁). For each of the data types we researched, we'll brainstorm examples of how we might use that data type in a grocery store app.

<div class="try-it">

    <div class="hidden">  
      <p>A <span class="vocab">string</span> is a data type used represent text. Strings can contain alphabet characters in addition to spaces, numbers, and special characters.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <li><code>"two roads diverged in a yellow wood"</code></li>

  <p>What sorts of data in your shopping app would be integer data? What about float data?</p>
  <div class="toggle-show">
    Integers and Floats Definition (click here)
    <div class="hidden">
      <p><strong><span class="vocab">Integer</span>:</strong> An integer is a whole number (not a fraction) that can be positive, negative, or zero. Unlike floating point numbers, integers cannot have decimal places.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <li><code>10</code></li>
      <li><code>0</code></li>
      <li><code>-25</code></li>
      <li><code>5148</code></li>
      <p><strong><span class="vocab">Float</span>:</strong> As the name implies, floating point numbers are numbers that contain floating decimal points. They can be positive or negative.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <li><code>-5.5</code></li>
      <li><code>0.0001</code></li>
      <li><code>98.2</code></li>

  <div class="toggle-show">
    Boolean Definition (click here)
    <div class="hidden">
      <p>A <span class="vocab">boolean</span> value is either true or false. Boolean values are used in boolean logic, which is a subset of algebra used for creating true/false statements.</p> 
      <p>As a side note beyond the scope of today's lesson, boolean expressions use the operators AND, OR, and NOT to compare values and return a true or false result. An example of booleans in real life might be:
      </p>
      <p>If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it's raining</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have an appointment</span>, then grab the umbrella.</p>

  <p>What might you want to store in an array in your shopping app? Start all of your answers with "list of..." </p>
  <div class="toggle-show">
    Array Definition (click here)
    <div class="hidden">
      <p>An <span class="vocab">array</span> is a data structure that represents a group of things.</p> 
      <p>You can think of an array as a collection, box, or container. Instead of saying "I have a collection of shirts," you could say "I have an array of shirts." The phrase "a container of pencils" would become "an array of pencils."</p>
      <p>Typically, elements in an array are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string. Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <li><code>[26, 24, 28, 25, 27, 27, 26, 27]</code></li>
      <li><code>["Mod 0", "Mod 1", "Mod 2", "Mod 3", "Mod 4"]</code></li>

  <p>What might you want to store as a hash/object (data in key-value format) in your shopping app?</p>
  <div class="toggle-show">
    Hash/Object Whole Group Review (click here)
    <div class="hidden">
      <p>A <span class="vocab">hash</span> or <span class="vocab">object</span> is a collection of key-value pairs. It is similar to an array in that it is a collection of things, but in the case of hashes/objects, we are <strong>pairing</strong> data together.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, this data type is referred to as a dictionary because of the pairing of word -> definition.</p>
      <p>For example, you might have a hash/object where the keys are first names and the values are last names.</p>
      <p>When I think about whether or not I need to use a hash, I ask myself "Is this a collection of data where the pairing of items matters?"</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <li><code>{ "9th grade": 110, "10th grade": 125, "11th grade": 66, "12th grade": 70}</code></li>

<a name="iteration"></a>
## Iteration

Iteration (or looping for a specified number of times) is a process of repeating a task for each object in a collection. For each of the scenarios below, we'll walk through using props to demonstrate the concept.

### Iteration in Real Life

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Scenario</th>
      <th>Collection</th>
      <th>For each...</th>
      <th>Do this:</th>
      <th>Then:</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Grading papers</td>
      <td>papers</td>
      <td>paper</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>read through it</li>
          <li>mark the score on the top</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>repeat with next paper</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Feeding animals</td>
      <td>animals</td>
      <td>animal</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>bring the animal to the food bucket</li>
          <li>allow the animal to eat</li>
          <li>bring animal back to barn</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>repeat with next animal</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Iteration Syntax

We'll go into breakout rooms to briefly discuss the syntax for iterating in Ruby and JavaScript. 

<div>
  Are you a <button class="iteration-toggle" id="fe-show">front end</button> or <button class="iteration-toggle" id="be-show">back end</button> student?
<div class="hidden fe-iteration">
  <p>The code that you see below is written using JavaScript. This syntax is something that you'll see all over the place, so it's important to get used to it. You don't need to memorize every little symbol for now, but knowing how to explain the big pieces is important.</p>
  <h4>Example #1: Grading papers for five students</h4>
  <iframe height="350px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@rwarbelow/mod0iterationJS1?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
  <div class="things-to-note">
    <h4>Things to Note: For Loop Vocabulary</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><code>var students = ['Megan', 'Jose', 'Xavier', 'Ali', 'Miriam'];</code><br> We use Javascript keyword <code>var</code> to <span class="vocab">declare</span> a <span class="vocab">variable</span> <code>students</code> and assign the <span class="vocab">array</span> of <span class="vocab">strings</span> to the <span class="vocab">variable</span> <code>students</code>.</li>
      <li><code>for (i = 0; i < students.length; i++)</code><br> We use Javascript keyword <code>for</code> to begin setting up our <span class="vocab">for loop</span> which we will break down further.</li>
      <li><code>i = 0;</code><br><span class="vocab">Declare</span> our <span class="vocab">variable</span> <code>i</code> and assign it to the <span class="vocab">integer</span> 0</li>
      <li><code>i < students.length;</code><br> We set up our <span class="vocab">conditional</span> statement that the <span class="vocab">for loop</span> will evaluate before entering the loop. On the first run through <code>i = 0</code>, so this statement evaluates to <code>0 < students.length;</code>, which can be broken down further to <code>0 < 5</code>, which evaluates to true. Think of <span class="vocab">conditionals</span> as questions that always evaluate to true or false.
      </li>
      <li><code>i++</code><br>Our <span class="vocab">incrementer</span> that will add one to i each time we pass through the loop. Another way to think about it is each time <code>i < students.length</code> is true we will increment <code>i</code> by one for the next time we evaluate the <span class="vocab">conditional</span> <code>i < students.length</code> So, after we've run through the <span class="vocab">for loop</span> once, the <span class="vocab">for loop</span> looks like this: <code>(i = 1; i < students.length; i++)</code> the second time through. This can break down further to <code>(i = 1; 1 < 5; i++)</code></li> 
      <li><strong>Curly Brackets or Curly Braces:</strong>
      <code><br>
        {
          Within these brackets is where we do some kind of programming/logic to each element of our collection within our loop
        } 
      </code><br>
      <strong>Todo:</strong> Google <code>console.log</code> and other console methods that are available to you in a Javascript console.</li>
      <li><code>students[i]</code><br> Access the <span class="vocab">element</span> of the <code>students</code> <span class="vocab">array</span> at <span class="vocab">index position</span><code>i</code> which will change as <code>i</code> changes and we increment through the <span class="vocab">for loop</span>
      As we move through the loop this breaks down to <code>students[0]</code>, next time through the loop: <code>students[1]</code>, next time through the loop: <code>students[2]</code> ...</li>
  </ul>

## The End!

After this Zoom call is over, take 15 minutes on your own to digest the content from this lesson, including the notes you wrote in the text boxes. 

In addition, consider the following questions:
  - What do I understand from today?
  - When will I need what I just learned? 
  - What questions do I still have? 
  - What learning processes/behaviors did I exercise today?

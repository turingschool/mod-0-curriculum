## Learning Goals

- Develop a strategy for breaking down multi-step problems
- Practice writing pseudocode to explain the process
- Identify programming concepts that can achieve the goal

<br>

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Warm-Up</h3>
  <p>You have learned about some of the basic tools available to you in Ruby and JavaScript. The challenge for this lesson is to know when to use which tool and recalling basic syntax. Take 2 minutes to independently reflect on the following questions. Write down some notes to reference throughout the lesson.</p>
  <p><strong>For each tool listed below, what is the purpose and what is the basic syntax required?</strong> (If you don't have this memorized yet, that's okay! Using notes and resources is encouraged.)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conditionals</li>
    <li>For Statements (JavaScript) or .each Method (Ruby)</li>
    <li>Functions or Methods</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Problem Solving Process
With practice, you'll get faster at problem solving, but in the beginning it can be helpful to slow down the process and think through each step. We recommend using the following 8 steps to Problem Solving as a guide to help you get started.
1. **Restate the goal.** Reframe the end goal in your own words. Take note of *exactly* what you expect to happen.
1. **Consider the data.** What data types are you working with? Will you use parameters and arguments?
1. **Ask clarifying questions.** If anything is still unclear, pause for a moment to get clarification. You'll need to have a clear idea of both what you're hoping to accomplish and the data you're working with before you begin.
1. **Break it down.** Pseudocode the steps you might need to take. Write the steps in plain English, but you may use technical terms that reference data types or methods you think might be helpful.
1. **Research.** Is there anything in your pseudocode that you don't know how to do? Take note of that and use Google as a tool to find some things you might try.
1. **Start coding.** Use your pseudocode as a guide and start writing your code! Work in iterations, starting with the simplest possible output and slowly add layers of complexity.
1. **Stuck?** Go back to your pseudocode and rethink what you might be missing. You may need to reorder your steps to continue.
1. **Refactor.** After we've found one solution, it's always a good idea to go back and see if there's another simpler way to achieve the same result. Sometimes after solving a problem once, we are able to see it from a new perspective.


## A Note About Research
Google is a very helpful tool for software development, but it can take some practice to learn how to do effective searches. Follow the guidelines below to ensure you get the best possible search results.
- Include the programming language
- Include the data type (if applicable)
- Use technical terms
- Choose reliable sources (MDN or Ruby docs)

If the solution you're looking for isn't in the first two pages of results, it's probably not there. You might try reframing your search terms or use another resource, like your Turing community!

## Problem Solving Practice
Open the starter kit for your program (<a href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/problem-solving-starter-kit-1#index.js" target="blank">FE</a> or <a href="https://replit.com/@turingschool/problem-solving-starter-kit#main.rb" target="blank">BE</a>) and make a copy (fork).


There are 4 challenges available to you on this replit. The expectation is that you are able to successfully complete at least _one_ of these challenges, using the 8 steps of the Problem Solving Process. Remember that you _can_ use the resources and tools available to you: notes, Google, etc. If you are able to get through at least one of these challenges then you are on the right track! 

**Note:** You will be asked to include your pseudocode and final solution to one challenge in your Mod 0 Gist. Instructions are in the [CFU Section.](#check-for-understanding)

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Challenge 1</h3>
  <p>Write a method or function that accepts a string. The method or function should return a boolean that describes whether or not the string has an even number of characters.</p>
</div>

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Challenge 2</h3>
  <p>Write a method or function that takes an array of numbers as an argument.  The method or function should return the average of all the numbers, rounded to two decimal places.</p>
</div>

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Challenge 3</h3>
  <p>Start with an array of strings. Print all of the words in the array, that include the letter <strong>t</strong> or <strong>T</strong>.</p>
</div>

For Challenge 4, notice that we start with an array of integers, but our final output will be a string.

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>Challenge 4</h3>
  <p>Write a method or function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9) and returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number. For example, if you were given <code>[5, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]</code>, the method or function will return <code>555-123-4567</code>.</p>
</div>

## Continue to Strengthen This Skill
This was only an introduction to Problem Solving and pseudocoding. It’s a skill that you will continue to develop for years, so don’t beat yourself up if it’s still confusing or hard! 

Here are two more resources outside of Turing that also provide opportunities to strengthen this skill: 
- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) - Create a free account, choose your language, and start solving challenges right away! They get increasingly more challenging, so don't get discouaged if they are difficult.
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-problem-solving) - A free open source curriculum with a course on problem solving.

## Check For Understanding
Add a section to your Mod 0 Gist entitled `Problem Solving` and add your responses to these questions: 

1. Were you able to complete at least one of the challenges? 
1. Please include your pseudocode and final solution to _one_ challenge.
1. What resources and tools did you use to research your solution?
1. This 8-step process is definitely slower than starting by writing code. Why might this be helpful, even though it takes more time? 
1. What do you like about this process?
1. What might make this process challenging?
1. Are there any steps you would add or modify?

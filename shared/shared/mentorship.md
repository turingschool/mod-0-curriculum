  <h3>Prepare to Engage</h3>
  <p>Whether you are starting your day with this activity or wrapping up a long day of technical work with this, take a moment to ground yourself in why you became a student at Turing. This Career Development work is arguably the most valuable component of your education that will lead you into your new career.</p>
  <p>Take a moment to reset if needed, meditate, or do some physical stretches/movement to get yourself into the space you need to be in to engage in this work. Some optional guiding questions follow.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why did you come to Turing?</li>
    <li>What is the thing that will motivate you to keep going on the days/weeks you feel <em>most</em> challenged at Turing?</li>
  </ul>
